Write a C++ menu-driven program to implement List ADT using a singly linked list. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The List ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert Beginning
2. Insert End
3. Insert Position
4. Delete Beginning
5. Delete End
6. Delete Position
7. Search
8. Display
9. Display Reverse
10. Reverse Link
11. Exit


B. Write a C++ menu-driven program to implement List ADT using a singly linked list. You have a gethead() private member function that returns the address of the head value of a list. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The List ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert Ascending
2. Merge
3. Display
4. Exit

Option 1 inserts a node so the list is always in ascending order. Option 2 takes two lists as input, and merges two lists into a third list. The third list should also be in ascending order. Convert the file into a header file and include it in a C++ file. The second C++ consists of 3 lists and has the following operations,

1. Insert List1
2. Insert List2
3. Merge into List3
4. Display
5. Exit

The time complexity of operation 1 is O(n), operation 2 is O(m), and operation 3 should be done in O(n + m).
