Write a C++ menu-driven program to determine whether a number is a  Palindrome, Armstrong, or Perfect Number. Normal variable and array declarations are not allowed. Utilize dynamic memory allocation (DMA). Design proper functions, maintain boundary conditions, and follow coding best practices. The menu is as follows,

a.       Palindrome

b.      Armstrong Number

c.       Perfect Number

d.      Exit

 

2. Write a C++ menu-driven program that calculates and displays the area of a square, cube, rectangle, and cuboid. Consider length as the side value for the square and cuboid. Identify proper data members and member functions. Design and create an appropriate class for the given scenario.  Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow coding best practices. The menus are as follows,
 a) Square
 b) Cube
 c) Rectangle

 d) Cuboid
 e) Exit
